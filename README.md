# HTML-CSS-project--Twitter-Clone

# !! This is for educational purposes only !!

# This is a programming project using HTML and CSS to design a website's main page by eye, in this case a clone of twitter.com

# This was started as a task set from SuperSimpleDev's HTML and CSS course, here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc
# The specific task is Exercise 17d, which is shown at 6:30:15 into the video.

# The majority of features used are covered within the course, however I did use some features which weren't, after googling for certain solutions to problems I came across.
# Examples of these features would be, the CSS filter attribute and the display: inline-flex attribute. There are probably more but I did not take note when looking for some solutions, so whoever is reading, you may come across more...

# The tweet-templates.html file is not a direct part of the project, it just contains the code for quickly re-producing different the different formats of tweets, in HTML only (eg. text/image/video)

# I will say that is the only part of the code that contains comments, and minimal at that, so it is understandable if it is confusing, however I hope the class names by nature provide some clarity...

# Big thank you to SuperSimpleDev for such well structured and informative course. I did have some base knoweldge of HTML and CSS, but I have not used these languages for a few years, so this definitely refreshed my memory and in fact large amounts of the knowledge in the course was new to me.

# This took me quite a lot of hours (from my perspective), definitely more than making the youtube page, so I think my next step will be to move on to the JavaScript course. (after a break ;) ) Perhaps I will re-create the other website pages put into the challenge exercises in the future...
